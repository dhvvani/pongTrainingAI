# NEAT Pong AI

## Project Summary
Uses the NEAT algorithm to train AI to play the pong. I was interested in this project as I had to do a research paper on for an Artificial Intelligence course at UofM. My research topic was Genetic algorithms and Neural Networking. After only focusing heavily on researching during the winter semester, I thought to try and make practicle use of it during the summer in the form of a simple project. What better way to do this than begin with a different take on a classic game and some guidance from Tim Ruscica via his youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim)? 

## Libraries needed: 
The libraries required are neat (pip install neat-python) and pygame (pip install pygame). The code used to evaluate genomes and the configuration file used can be found at https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/xor_example.html with a few minor changes to the NEAT parameters in the first section in the configuration file.

## Learning outcomes and challenges
This project was also a way to practice using python, since academically, I had not yet been required to learn the language. Furthermore, in addition to a transition from theoretical knowledge to practical application of NNs, I also familiarised myself with the pygame library which can help in the graphics of prospective projects.
